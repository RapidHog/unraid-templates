Smoother support for MAM's multi-ASN sessions has been released. You will need to use a single session/mam_id. The previous multisession format will now produce an error.

 

This is a python script in a docker image which will provide session IP updates through the seedbox API. It is designed to be completely hands off after setup.

 

Features:

    Explains common error situations in plain english
    Detailed logging of IP changes and API responses
    Anticipates ratelimiting and avoids unnecessary API calls
    Apprise support for notifications

 

Installation:

 

See the github for the docker compose format: https://github.com/elforkhead/mamapi

 

Creating a session cookie/"MAM_ID" to authenticate:

    Visit your security preferences
    Create a session, ideally using the IP your first connection will be from
    The locked session selection should be "ASN"
    The dynamic seedbox selection should be "Yes"
    Copy the mam_id it provides - this will be used as the MAM_ID in my container
    Add additional ASNs when needed by inputting an associated IP through the 'Manage Session' menu and choosing 'Update the session'

 

If you choose to view the cookie/mam_id again after its first creation, the string will be regenerated and you will need to replace what you are using in the container.

Took a little poking to get it running on unRAID. (without compose) 

 

Seems to be working as intended, I appreciate your time on this. 

Thank you.

Any chance you remember the steps you did that you could provide? I am also an unraid user and looking for a way to automate my vpn ip address changing when restarting the container. Currently using the binhex qt docker image.

 

Edit: Looking at the github, it appears to just be a single python script which is easy enough to understand. I think my issue is that I have my vpn connection on a per docker basis instead of the entire system. I should  probably switch that to be unraid wide and then this would just work for me. I don't think it would work with my current setup (vpn included in docker).

If I'm understanding your usecase correctly, this container should be able to work for you without much tweaking. You need this container to share the networking of your binhex qt container. If you are using docker-compose, the easiest way to do this is to add this container as an additional service in the same compose file as binhex qt, and add network_mode: "service:nameofyourbinhexservice" underneath this container's service. This essentially runs all of the networking of this container through your VPN container.

 

If this works out well, this container will operate behind your container's vpn and use the VPN IP when updating myanonamouse.

 

If you're using CLI rather than docker compose, you can do something like docker run --network container:nameofyourvpncontainer nameofthiscontainersimage to do the same thing.

Just wanted to say thanks for this!

I couldn't get the other container to work, but this one booted right up and worked immediately! but my VPN IP hasn't changed yet so we'll see.

BTW, I'm running it as non-root and no privilege escalation and it seems to be working fine -

      - PUID=1000
      - GUID=1000

    security_opt:
  # Prevent escalation of privileges after the container is started
      - no-new-privileges:true

Would you open to adding a check time adjustment variable for the docker compost?

My VPN IP does change, not very often - I could easily set the check to once every 6 hours or even 24 hours and be fine - would lighten the load on the MAM API for those that are able to do so.

Typically it will only blindly hit the MAM API is on its first ever boot. That first response from the API tells the script the last API update time and what IP it was updated to. These are written to a .json so they persist through container restarts.

 

After that it only checks for changes to the external ip by pinging ipify.org every 5 minutes, and they don't care if you use it "millions of times a minute." If it detects a change in external IP, and it has been more than an hour since the last update to the MAM API (due to the ratelimit), it will only then ping MAM's API.

 

As I think about it make sure that UID/GID has read/write privileges on the data mount, I'm not sure how it will behave if it can't write.

Good to know, thanks! That makes more sense.

and yes I changed the data directory to something in that users path before deploying and it worked fine. Here's the full compose I used, with variables for the local stuff.

ervices:
  mamapi:
    image: elforkhead/mamapi:latest
    container_name: mamapi
    volumes:
      - ${VPN_CONFIG}:/data
    environment:
      - MAM_ID=${SESSION_ID}
      - DEBUG=True
      - PUID=1000
      - GUID=1000 # Run as a non-root user.
    network_mode: "container:gluetun"
    security_opt:
  # Prevent escalation of privileges after the container is started
      - no-new-privileges:true
    restart: 'unless-stopped'

I only have qbit and some proxy hosts behind my vpn (added socks5 to gluetun)

but my Arrs use the proxy via prowlarr. I'm not sure why people discourage it, i haven't had an issue. but every use case is unique. 

 

UNRAID 7.0.0

 

Repository : elforkhead/mamapi:latest

Support Thread : https://github.com/elforkhead/mamapi

Network Type : Container

Container Network : GluetunVPN (yours may be binhex-qbittorentvpn)

Use Tailscale : Off

Privileged : Off

 

Variable : MAM_ID (your ID)

Variable : DEBUG (True/*blank*)

Path : /data

the mount point ends up being (for me).

/data > /mnt/user/appdata/mamapi

I was able to get it working by deleting the session and re-adding it.

One thing I still do not understand and none of the VPN guides make clear: Which cookie are you supposed to grab?

There are at least 4 different cookies you could end up with:

-Add a session via IP > Will show you a cookie

-Allow Session to set Dynamic seedbox IP > will generate a new cookie (if you view it)

-Switch to ASN Locked session > will generate a new cookie (if you view it)

-Clicking the View cookie at any time will generate a cookie

 

Which of these is supposed to be enabled AND at which stage are you supposed to view the cookie and save it to the container?

Thanks, I pushed a fix for the logger typo. If you want it, make sure you pull a fresh container image. While it crashed due to the typo, you were only like one or two lines away from an exit due to the invalid session which I think is the main issue you're having.

 

I put a guide for generating a proper mam_id/session in the OP.

Thanks! This is the kicker that seems to be missing from the other guides. 

Seems to be running cleanly now, I'll monitor.

I have searched a few times trying to find the MAM documentation for ASN Lock sessions and havent come up with it, but I probably just don't know where to look.

Nice job! just wondering is there an advantage or difference when using this container or the container made by @metcalfe:

 

https://www.myanonamouse.net/f/t/76123/p/p878526#878526 ?

 

I'm using the one created by @metcalfe now and it does it job for me as far as I can tell

I made this container because metcalfe's declares the session/cookie file invalid and exits if you are ratelimited. If your VPN IP happens to change twice in an hour, the container crashes.

 

Here are the docker logs in this situation from metcalfe's container:

    + echo response: '{"Success":false,"msg":"Last' change too 'recent"}'
    + echo Current cookie file is invalid. Please delete it, set the mam_id, and restart the container.
    response: {"Success":false,"msg":"Last change too recent"}
    + exit 1
    Current cookie file is invalid. Please delete it, set the mam_id, and restart the container.

 

Here's what mine looks like if it hits an unexpected ratelimit:

    [2025-04-19 12:06:07] [INFO] Detected IP change. Old IP: 'redacted' New IP: 'redacted'
    [2025-04-19 12:06:07] [INFO] Sending cookie to MAM...
    [2025-04-19 12:06:08] [INFO] Received response: 'last change too recent'
    [2025-04-19 12:06:08] [WARNING] MAM rejects due to last change too recent, and last successful update is unknown: retrying in 30 minutes

My script can anticipate ratelimiting by recording the last time it updated MAM, so it won't even bother hitting MAM's API in this situation after it has been running for a while, it will calculate how long it has to wait (61 minutes after the last update) before hitting the API again.

Seems like I'm going to give this a try.

 

Thinking about your example: If the IP changes within an hour after the last IP update, the user will not be able to communicate with MAM (download/seed) until after that hour expires and the IP update will be sent.

Is that correct?

 

If so, nothing you can do about it, of course, and at least the situation will 'auto-correct' instead of the container exiting completely.

That's the gist of it. I have found that my seeding sometimes continues even with a session IP that's out of date, but downloads usually fail.

I've been using this now for a couple of weeks and they have been very uneventful weeks... which is just how I like it. Container just works, no problems.

So just a little feedback that it so far works fine for me

Thanks for creating this @elforkhead

Me using the container from @elforkhead now doesn't mean I didn't appreciate the work done by @metcalfe. That would make no sense. That container made me understand the process and probably was a stepping stone for @elforkhead to try to improve upon. We all stand on the shoulders of someone else. That's how things get improved.

I've encountered some problems with the container continuously restarting.  Error in log has to do with invalid ASN session cookie or something.  I've had to delete the .json file, delete the container, then get a new mam cookie and rebuild the project.

 

what IP to use remains the biggest question mark for me.  as long as i am "still" connectable  I can right click on the "Connectable:" near the ratio and get the correct, working IP.  Then enter that, allow the session to set dynamic seedbox IP, then view the IP locked session cookie, and copy that, and use that in the YAML for the container, and rebuild. do not turn on ASN. now all good.

 

just what if I was not connectable? where would I then obtain the (transmissionopenvpn) container's IP?
